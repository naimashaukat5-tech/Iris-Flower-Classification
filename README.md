# Iris-Flower-Classification
ðŸŒ¸ Iris Flower Classification
Overview:

This project applies Machine Learning to classify Iris flowers into three species:

Setosa

Versicolor

Virginica

The dataset used is the Iris dataset, one of the most popular datasets in data science and machine learning.

Objectives:

Load and explore the Iris dataset

Train machine learning models to classify flowers

Evaluate performance with test data

Understand basic classification concepts in ML

Tools & Libraries:

Python

Scikit-learn

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib / Seaborn

Steps Performed:

Data Loading â€“ Loaded the Iris dataset using Scikit-learn

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ Visualized and understood feature distributions

Data Preprocessing â€“ Handled features and split data into train/test sets

Model Training â€“ Trained classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)

Evaluation â€“ Checked model accuracy and performance on test data

ðŸ“Š Results

Achieved high accuracy in predicting the correct Iris species

Learned how feature measurements (sepal & petal dimensions) influence classification
